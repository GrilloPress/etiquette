#### Disclaimer

In this book we'll create a helpdesk type application. If you are thinking "harumph... that isn't something I ever wanted to create" you should consider a few things.

1. Every serious app needs some form of FAQ/Helpdesk
2. Most major companies have some form of CRM/Helpdesk app running
3. This is just a sample app

But most importantly,

4. Most of the components we create are those you'll see in a basic website (static pages, a contact form and a way for admins to create repeatable content)

So, even if you don't think a simple helpdesk is the most exciting app ever, it'll give you the skills to create an app or website you need.
